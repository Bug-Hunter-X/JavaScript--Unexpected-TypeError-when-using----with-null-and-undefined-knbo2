# JavaScript Bug: Unexpected TypeError with null and undefined

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in JavaScript related to handling null and undefined values when checking length.

## Bug Description
The `foo` function attempts to handle null and undefined inputs gracefully. However, it uses the loose equality operator (`==`) which does not differentiate between null and undefined.  This leads to a `TypeError` when an undefined value is passed, as attempting to access the `length` property of `undefined` is invalid. 

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.js` using a JavaScript interpreter (e.g., Node.js).
3. Observe the `TypeError` when calling `foo(undefined)`. 

## Solution
The solution uses the strict equality operator (`===`) and checks for both `null` and `undefined` explicitly using the `||` operator or `Optional Chaining` for better type checking.  This makes the type handling explicit and eliminates the unexpected error.  See `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.
